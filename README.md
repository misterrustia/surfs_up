The key differences between the Months of December and June are that the low in december is 56 and the low in June is 64 which is almost ten degrees higher.

In June the 25th quartile is 74 degress while in December the 25th quartile is 69 degress. 

The max temp for June and December are 85 and 83 degrees respectivly. 

As the mean, max and quartiles are all close to each other for the dead of winter and middle of the summer I think some deeper analysis of specific locations on the island would be helpful. 

first if the locations of the stations could be seperated by what side of the islands they are on then you could figure out the percipitation and temperature for each microclimate per season.
This would allow for a much more accurate assesment of when the most ideal weather would occur. 
Another analysis that could be done would be to find other icecream stores on the island and to compare their buisest seasons with the weather and tourism waves. 
As the middle of winter is not actaully "cold" to most peoples standards the waves of tourism could have a effect that should be included into buisness decisions.
